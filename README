The Crystallographic Data Toolkit (CDTK) is a collection of Python
modules for working with crystallographic data on biomolecules.

For more information, see the tutorial (Doc/tutorial.pdf) and the
reference manual (Doc/reference/index.html).

CDTK is distributed under the CeCILL-C licence. See the file
LICENCE (in English) or LICENSE (in French) for the details of this

The mmCIF parser (module CDTK.mmCIF) was taken from version 1.0.0 of
the Python Macromolecular Library (mmLib), written by Jay Painter and
Ethan Merritt. PyMMLIB is published under the Artistic License.

Installation:
-------------

Prerequisites: 

- Python 2.5 or higher: 
      http://www.python.org/

- Numerical Python or its successor NumPy:
      http://numpy.scipy.org/

- ScientificPython 2.7 or higher:
      http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/

- FFTW3:
      http://www.fftw.org/

CDTK will use Numeric or NumPy depending on how ScientificPython has been
configured. The MTZ file reader requires the CCP4 library, whose location
should be indicated by the environment variable 'CCP4'. If this variable
is not defined the MTZ file reader will not be installed.

Installation is as simple as

    python setup.py build
    python setup.py install

(the second command requires root privileges on many installations).
