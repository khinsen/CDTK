PDB_MMCIF_PATH (for the structure files in mmCIF format), the data
is taken from there. Otherwise, the required PDB files are downloaded
from the main PDB server. Note that if the structure factor file does
not contain the unit cell parameters or the symmetry group, this
information is taken from the mmCIF structure file.
